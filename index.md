lexapro reviews

As for me, since my childhood I was quite sensitive, with eyes on a wet place, easily frustrated. But it all came and went, I did not worry for a long time on the same topic, it did not lexapro reviews cycle. I have never had a lot of energy, but there was no loss of strength, apathy. And for the time being, there was no anxiety.

But with age, something began to change. Nalilis worries, anxieties, problems, the most serious of which was infertility. And on this basis neurosis developed (or more modern name - anxiety disorder). I will not describe the features of this diagnosis, to whom this is important - he is aware. I can only say that it is not depression, in lexapro dosage which a person is so bad that he can go out the window (yes, that’s because depression is not just a bad mood, as many people think). But also an unpleasant and serious condition that has its own symptoms, diagnostic criteria, approaches to treatment.

In general, when I realized that I no longer cope, and all other methods to stop worrying, calm down and start enjoying life do not take me (and I tried to get out on my own for quite some time), I lexapro 5mg turned to a psychotherapist. Which at first appointed me first Grandaxine, and then Tsipralex. Have I been afraid to drink an antidepressant?

Take 5 mg (1/2 tablet) of Tsipraleks in the morning after breakfast daily for the first 3-5 days. Next, if everything is in order, go to the whole pill (10 mg) or contact your doctor to adjust the therapy. Additionally, take Grandaxine and Teraligen for reducing the side effects of taking Tsipraleks. As I wrote above, I took Grandaksin before, but as a monotherapy, so his appointment as a couple to Cipralex did not scare me - the fact is that anxiety may increase at the beginning of the antidepressant use, and Grandaxine cleans it perfectly.

Absolutely irresistible drowsiness. It began within 1-2 hours after taking the pill, it took place only in the evening. Before lunch, I could not get out of bed at all. It’s good that I didn’t work at that time. It would be just impossible. Like driving a car. Drowsiness continued for the first 2 weeks of taking Tsipraleksa, then disappeared without a trace. At about 5 in the morning I woke up with a feeling of nervous excitement, palpitations. Before the alarm clock, it was already very bad. It lasted about a week, then it ended too.

But just as quickly as a side job, I received the first positive result. Before I started taking Tsipraleks, I woke up every day with a feeling of intense melancholy (whoever had it - he would understand the oppressive drawing feeling in his soul, no joy from the upcoming new day). Tosca is gone after the second reception Tsipraleksa !!! This is how I quickly received at least some relief, and this was already important and valuable.
